#### ðŸ¤” Where are all these problems coming / created from? Are these just for Fun such as a Game or they actually hold some significance in real world

#### ðŸ¤” Can I connect problem(s) to a practical use case rather than just thinking in NOs?

- Find count of distinct element in an Array

  > *Brute Force Approach*
  >
  > *Extra space Approach (HashMap)*
  >
  > If Array is sorted already then no extra space needed

  All these above approaches move from Naive to Optimised but what happens if the input size keeps on increasing with time? ***Find no of users who are online at any given point***

  > Precompute and keep track of count (Incereasing / decreasing) but it still needs extra space
